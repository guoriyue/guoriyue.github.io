A set of photographs tells us what a scene looks like from a few cameras. How can
we build something that produces an image from a camera we have not seen before?

One answer is to represent the scene as many soft, colored blobs in three
dimensions. Move a camera around them, project them onto an image, and blend their
contributions. Then adjust the blobs until those rendered images resemble the
photographs. That is the core idea behind **3D Gaussian Splatting**, or **3DGS**.

I built [3dgs-warp-scratch](https://github.com/guoriyue/3dgs-warp-scratch) to make
that process inspectable in Python. It includes the forward renderer, explicit
backward gradients, parameter updates, and the logic that adds or removes
Gaussians during training. NVIDIA Warp supplies the compiled parallel kernels.
This article follows one image through that implementation.

## What is a Gaussian in a scene?

A point has a position but no size. A Gaussian has a center and a soft extent:
its influence is strongest near the center and falls off farther away. Stretch
it differently along three axes, then rotate it, and you get an oriented
ellipsoid rather than a sphere.

We attach appearance parameters to that shape:

| Parameter | What it controls |
|---|---|
| Position | Where the Gaussian sits in the scene |
| Scale | How far it extends along each of three axes |
| Rotation | Which way those axes point |
| Opacity | How strongly it can contribute to an image |
| Color coefficients | How its color changes with viewing direction |

A scene is a collection of these records. There is no triangle mesh connecting
their centers. The rendered surface emerges from the combined contribution of
many overlapping Gaussians.

The **covariance matrix** describes the Gaussian's shape and orientation. Rather
than optimizing arbitrary entries of that matrix, the renderer constructs it
from scales and a rotation. In mathematical notation:

```text
Σ = R S Sᵀ Rᵀ
```

`S` is a diagonal matrix containing the three scales. `R` rotates the axes, and
`ᵀ` means transpose. This is a compact way to describe an ellipsoid whose shape
can change during training. In the code, `compute_cov3d` performs that conversion.

## From a 3D blob to a 2D footprint

Rendering starts with a camera. Its position and orientation tell us where the
scene is relative to the viewer; its focal length tells us how that scene maps
onto the image.

First transform a Gaussian's center into camera coordinates. With a simple
perspective camera, the horizontal image coordinate is proportional to `x / z`.
That division explains why distant objects appear smaller. The vertical
coordinate works the same way.

But projecting only the center would leave a single dot. We also need to project
the Gaussian's extent. Around each center, the renderer uses a local linear
approximation to perspective. The **Jacobian** is the matrix describing that local
change: how a small movement in 3D changes the projected position.

The shape transformation is:

```text
Σscreen = J W Σworld Wᵀ Jᵀ
```

`W` rotates world-space directions into camera coordinates. `J` describes the
local projection. The result is a 2D covariance: the size and orientation of an
elliptical footprint on the screen. It is an approximation around the center,
not an exact perspective projection of the entire 3D Gaussian.

The renderer also computes the inverse of this 2D covariance. The code calls its
three independent entries a **conic**. Those numbers let each pixel evaluate how
far it lies from the center in the ellipse's own coordinate system. A long, thin
ellipse falls off slowly along its long direction and quickly across its short
direction. The `compute_cov2d` and `wp_preprocess` functions prepare this information.

## Why the renderer groups work into tiles

Testing every Gaussian against every pixel would spend most of its time on pairs
that cannot affect one another. A Gaussian on the left side of an image usually
has nothing to contribute to the far right side.

This renderer divides the image into **16 × 16 pixel tiles**. For each projected
Gaussian, it estimates a bounded footprint and records the tiles that footprint
overlaps. A prefix sum reserves space for those records. The renderer then builds
pairs containing a Gaussian ID and a key combining tile ID with depth.

Sorting the keys groups records by tile and orders the Gaussians within each tile
from near to far. Each pixel only walks the candidate list for its own tile. The
ellipse evaluation still decides how much a candidate actually contributes.

The same Gaussian can appear in several tile lists. This duplicates an ID and a
sorting key; it does not create several independently trainable Gaussians.
`wp_duplicate_with_keys`, `wp_identify_tile_ranges`, and the call to
`wp.utils.radix_sort_pairs` make this organization explicit.
[Source: forward.py](https://github.com/guoriyue/3dgs-warp-scratch/blob/752b4da13b5e4aa9d7139d0d2df2ca9e9503f7eb/forward.py).

## Blending: one pixel, two Gaussians

A projected Gaussian does not paint every covered pixel with the same strength.
Its per-pixel **alpha** combines its opacity with the Gaussian falloff at that
pixel. Near the center the contribution is stronger; toward the edges it fades.

Now imagine a red Gaussian in front of a blue Gaussian. At one particular pixel,
the red one has alpha `0.5` and the blue one has alpha `0.4`. Start with a black
background and a remaining visibility, or **transmittance**, of `1`.

| Contribution | Weight | Visibility left afterward |
|---|---|---|
| Front red Gaussian | `1 × 0.5 = 0.5` | `1 × (1 − 0.5) = 0.5` |
| Back blue Gaussian | `0.5 × 0.4 = 0.2` | `0.5 × (1 − 0.4) = 0.3` |
| Background | `0.3` | — |

The final RGB value is `[0.5, 0, 0.2]` for a black background. The blue Gaussian
gets less influence because the red Gaussian has already covered part of the
pixel. Reverse their order and the result changes. That is why depth sorting is
part of rendering, not just a memory optimization.

For each candidate, the accumulation rule is:

```text
color = color + transmittance × alpha × gaussian_color
transmittance = transmittance × (1 − alpha)
```

These are explanatory equations, not a complete rendering kernel. The actual
implementation caps alpha, ignores very small contributions, and stops processing
when the remaining visibility becomes sufficiently small. It then adds the
background weighted by the visibility that remains. This happens in
`wp_render_gaussians`.

## Color can depend on the camera

A fixed RGB value cannot describe every appearance change as the camera moves.
The project stores **spherical harmonic coefficients**: weights for a small set
of smooth functions of viewing direction. Evaluate those functions for the current
camera direction, combine them using the weights, and obtain the Gaussian's color.

Degree zero supplies a direction-independent component. Higher degrees add
variation over direction. The training code allocates 16 RGB coefficients per
Gaussian, corresponding to degree three. These coefficients represent appearance;
they do not turn the renderer into a physical lighting simulation.

## Training runs the reasoning backward

So far, the renderer answers: “Given these Gaussians and this camera, what image
do I get?” Training asks: “How should the Gaussians change to make this image
closer to the photograph?”

In this implementation, one training iteration chooses a camera, renders an
image, and computes an **L1 loss**: the average absolute difference between
predicted and target color channels. The active loop uses L1, even though the
repository also contains some SSIM-related code.

A **gradient** measures how a small parameter change affects the loss. The backward
pass starts with gradients for pixel colors and follows the rendering operations
in reverse: through blending, the elliptical footprints, projection, and finally
the Gaussian positions, scales, rotations, opacities, and color coefficients.

Many pixels can contribute a gradient to the same Gaussian. Those contributions
must be accumulated. The project implements its backward kernels explicitly in
`backward.py`; the training loop does not simply ask a Warp tape to differentiate
the entire renderer. Adam then uses the gradients and running statistics to update
the parameters.

```text
Gaussians + camera → rendered image → image loss
       ↑                                  ↓
 parameter update ← parameter gradients ← pixel gradients
```

The forward pass saves intermediate buffers because the backward pass needs to
know which Gaussians contributed and how they were blended.

[optimizer](https://github.com/guoriyue/3dgs-warp-scratch/blob/752b4da13b5e4aa9d7139d0d2df2ca9e9503f7eb/optimizer.py).

## Learning how many Gaussians to use

Moving a fixed set of blobs is not always enough. A large blob may cover a region
that needs finer detail, while an almost invisible blob may consume storage
without helping the image.

**Densification** changes the representation itself. This implementation marks
small Gaussians with large gradient signals for cloning, and larger ones for
splitting. **Pruning** removes candidates with sufficiently low opacity. The
trainer coordinates these operations on a schedule and adjusts the parameter and
optimizer buffers as the number of Gaussians changes.

These are discrete changes to the scene, separate from the continuous parameter
updates made by Adam. The distinction matters: training learns both the parameters
of the current representation and, through these rules, where to allocate more
representation capacity.

For the supplied training path, initialization starts with random positions.
It is not loading a structure-from-motion point cloud, even though point-cloud
initialization is part of the original 3DGS method. Read the actual initializer
when following this implementation.

## What Warp contributes

Warp compiles typed Python kernel functions for parallel execution on CPUs or
supported NVIDIA GPUs. In this project, `@wp.kernel` marks a kernel,
`wp.launch` supplies its execution dimensions and inputs, and `wp.tid()` identifies
which element of that parallel work a kernel invocation handles.
[Warp documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/warp/stable/).

That lets the rendering math remain in Python source while still describing work
per Gaussian or per pixel. It does not make the surrounding Python training loop
run as one GPU kernel, and it does not automatically supply the renderer's
algorithm or gradient formulas.

The repository's device selection lives in `config.py`. At the revision linked
here it is set to `"cuda"`, despite the README describing CPU as the default.
Warp supports CPU execution, but GPU use still requires compatible hardware and
drivers.

| File | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| `render.py` | What does a minimal scene of three Gaussians look like? |

The three-Gaussian scene is a useful starting point because it isolates rendering
from training. The Lego example adds images, camera poses, gradients, and updates
to that same forward process. Installation and entry points are in the
[repository README](https://github.com/guoriyue/3dgs-warp-scratch).

The method comes from [Kerbl et al.'s 3D Gaussian Splatting paper](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/).
This project's forward and backward implementations draw on
[graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting),
and its densification and pruning logic draws on
[gaussian-splatting-lightning](https://github.com/yzslab/gaussian-splatting-lightning).
The purpose of this reimplementation is to make the path from a scene description
to a trainable image generator easier to follow.
